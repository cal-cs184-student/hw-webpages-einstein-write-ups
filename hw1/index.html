		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		a. I rasterized the triangle by creating boundaries as close to the triangle as possible. I did this by doing xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax. I then created a double for loop to check each of my pixels and add 0.5 to get the middle of the pixel instead of the edge of a pixel. We then compute whether or not the current pixel we are on are within the edges of the triangle (all positive, all counter clockwise or all negative, clockwise) based on the if statement condition. I used the line equation given in lecture: Li(x, y) = –(x - Xi) dYi + (y - Yi) dXi to calculate each of the edges in order to see if my point lands within my triangle. <br>
		<br> b. My algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because I make my boundaries as tight as possible with my xmin, xmax, ymin, and max. There is no reason to check a pixel outside of this boundary if it’s not near my image since there is no way it would be impossible to be in the triangle. <br>

		<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
		<br>Our supersampling algorithm allows us to manipulate task 1 rasterize_triangle function to include another double for loop to loop through the sample rate. We were able to access subpixels based on the supersampling rate instead of just looking at a single sample pixel. For the data structure I was able to utilize a sample buffer which essentially stores colors at each subpixel before I average it for the overall final pixel. This way we can access the sample buffers and fill in the pixel depending if the sample point falls in the triangle using the edge_function where each subpixel is tested individually then stored in our sample buffer before we downsample in resolve_to_framebuffer.  <br>
		<br>Supersampling is useful, so that we can more clear cut pictures with no jaggies and no gaps and essentially reduce aliasing. Modifications I made to the rasterization pipeline process increased my sample resolution, so that I don’t just use one single color per pixel, introduced a sample buffer to store my subpixels before averaging it to the final overall pixel, adjusted the rasterize_triangle to now iterate over subpixels too now instead of just one pixel, and finally we did downsampling where we averaged them to apply to the final overall pixel to allow smooth edges when we transition between the edges of the subpixels.  I used supersampling to antialias my triangles by increasing my supersample rate per pixel to close the gap and create a blurred effect to make the images have no jagged edges and smooth out the lines by allowing smooth transitions. <br>
		<br>Overall, this effectively averages out the results by sampling more and multiple points for a single pixel by measuring the subpixels leading to better images with no gaps and jaggies. <br>
		<br>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 50%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<br> These results are zoomed in a space where there is a gap in sample rate 1 since we will be able to look at an interesting point in the image. By observing this interesting point, we can see how antialiasing by supersampling closes that gap when we increase our sample rate and how the image gets clearer with finer lines (no jaggies) and no gap like we saw in sample rate 1. 


		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>

		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		<br>Barycentric coordinates allow me to interpolate across a triangle to do the weighted average for the colors of the 3 vertices - red, green, and blue. We can get the weighted average by multiplying each vertext's color with the respecive barycentric coodinate and sum up the results. If the point is closer to a vertex, it would be a stronger shade of that vertex’s color. For example, if a point is closer to the red vertex and therefore appears a shade of red. This interpolation creates a smoothly blended transition of colors over a continuous space over discrete points. <br>

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		Pixel sampling is a process whereby the color of a pixel is determined as a function of a randomly sampled part of the pixel. In order to describe more detail the methodology used to determine the color of a pixel, I will go into how  pixel sampling is implemented in our project. Here, pixel sampling is implemented by first setting up the triangle’s bounding box in order to determine the portion of the screen covered by the triangle: this involves computing the minimum and maximum values along its vertices in order to define its boundaries. Supersampling to reduce anti-aliasing is then performed; the process here is to  subdivide the pixels in the bounding box into a grid of subpixels, iterate over them, and then use line equation tests to test whether or not they are in the triangle (a pixel is in the triangle iff all three of the functions in the test are positive). Barycentric weights are then computed from the line equations according to the formulas from lecture 5, which are then interpolated from the vertices’ texture coordinates. For nearest neighbor sampling, the interpolated coordinates are clamped to the [0,1] range, multiplied by the texture dimensions, and then rounded to the nearest integer. For bilinear sampling, (u,v) sampling subtracts 0.5 from each coordinate to align with texel centers; the integer coordinates and then fractional parts are computed according to the formulas from lecture 5. Then the four neighboring levels are fetched. Finally, once the texture color is fetched it is written in the supersample buffer at the correct index. <br>

		<br> 
		After I first implemented task 5, supersampling wasn’t being performed, so I used chat-GPT to effectuate this. (My use of chat-GPT for code-writing consisted of me showing it the instructions for task 5 as well as the code I had so far which had rendered the images without supersampling; I used the snippet it had produced for specifically the supersampling part of tasl 5 in order to supersample correctly. I additionally used Chat-GPT to ask conceptual questions about how pixel sampling should be performed according to these methods, e.g. to ask "how is supersampling integrated with the nearest neighbors method in pixel sampling" and what I learned in this part is described in the previous paragraph). I realized that the problem was that I wasn’t directly iterating over the supersample grid upon seeing the correct version of the code; I thus learned that this is an integral part in the implementation of supersampling. <br>
		<br> 
		The following is an example for which bilinear sampling yields a definitively better image than nearest sampling. Comparing images of the same supersample rate, we can see that nearest sampling renders a sort of cross with a grey vertical line and white horizontal line around the center of the photo, whereas bilinear sampling has a much more continuous rendering of this grey line, in which it blends in a lot more with its background.

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		Level sampling is a technique used in texture mapping to dynamically select the appropriate level of detail from a mipmap based on how much a texture is being scaled on screen.When using linear level sampling, the final texture color is computed as a weighted average of samples taken from both the lower and upper mipmap levels, with the weights determined by the fractional part of the level value. It effectively minimizes aliasing artifacts and preserves texture detail by adapting the texture resolution to match the screen-space coverage, resulting in smoother transitions and a more visually appealing rendering outcome.
In our implementation for task 6, we begin by computing the derivatives of the interpolated texture coordinates in the x and y directions. These derivatives, which represent how rapidly the texture coordinates change from one pixel to the next, are scaled by the width and height of the full-resolution texture. This scaling converts the change in normalized texture space into texel space, allowing us to estimate the number of texels covered by a single pixel. By taking the maximum of the magnitudes of these derivative vectors and applying a base-2 logarithm, we obtain a continuous mipmap level value that indicates the appropriate level of detail for that fragment. Depending on the user-selected level sampling method, our implementation either rounds this level value to the nearest integer for nearest-level sampling or uses it to interpolate between the two adjacent mipmap levels. 
In my workflow for this task, I used chat GPT after the changes weren’t significant enough when changing levels. Upon seeing its solution, I realized that I was clamping integers such that they were rounded to 0 all the time, so that we effectively weren’t switching between levels. <br>


		<br> When comparing the four combinations, L_ZERO with P_NEAREST is the simplest and fastest because it always samples from the full-resolution texture using nearest neighbor interpolation. This minimizes computation and memory accesses since no additional mipmap level selection is performed, but it suffers from poor anti-aliasing, leading to visible aliasing artifacts when textures are minified. In contrast, L_ZERO with P_LINEAR still uses the full-resolution level but applies bilinear interpolation, resulting in smoother transitions between texels and improved visual quality, though it is slightly slower due to the extra arithmetic involved in the interpolation process. Moving on to L_NEAREST, this mode computes the appropriate mipmap level by evaluating the derivatives of the texture coordinates, and then rounds the computed level to the nearest integer before sampling. When combined with P_NEAREST, the renderer benefits from reduced aliasing through the use of pre-filtered, lower resolution mipmap levels, at the cost of additional derivative computations; however, the nearest neighbor method still remains relatively efficient. Finally, L_NEAREST with P_LINEAR takes advantage of both appropriate mipmap selection and bilinear filtering, resulting in even smoother, more continuous texture appearance and superior anti-aliasing, especially for minified textures. This combination, while providing the best visual quality among the four, incurs the highest computational cost due to both the derivative evaluations for level selection and the more intensive bilinear interpolation process, though memory usage remains largely similar across all methods since the full mipmap hierarchy is generated in every case.
